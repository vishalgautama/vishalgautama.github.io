I am a first-year Aerospace Engineering Masters student at the Aerospace Department of Virginia Tech. Currently looking for advisors to to pursue my research focusing on developing advance and intelligence propulsion system for the next generation of aircraft. I am a former aerospace engineer with experience in designing large to medium sized unmanned aerial vehicles and air-taxi.
At the age of eight (2005), I began my aeronautics journey with my first RC plane, a Fiesler Storch. In my Aerospace Engineering undergrad at UPES, I designed the recovery system for a sounding rocket that represented India, reaching an altitude of 10,000 feet in the 2017 international competition by Spaceport America and ESRA in the United States. I’m experienced in designing propulsion system for advance hybrid and electric Unmanned Aerial Systems in my role at VTOL Aviation India. Currently I’m working on the
design and development of a six-seater VTOL air taxi. My specializations lies in Fluid Mechanics, Flight Mechanics, Thermodynamics and Electro-mechanical systems development.
My academic interests are Adaptive, Autonomous and Nonlinear Control for Intelligent Propulsion Systems.
