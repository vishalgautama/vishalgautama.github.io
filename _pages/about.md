I am a graduate student in Aerospace Engineering at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/) and a member of the [Nonlinear Systems Laboratory](https://nsl.aoe.vt.edu/). My work focuses on adaptive control, nonlinear systems, and six degree of freedom modeling and simulation, with applications to propulsion and hardware based testing.

I completed my undergraduate studies at [UPES](https://www.upes.ac.in/) in India and worked on eVTOL and multirotor aircraft systems at [VTOL Aviation India](https://www.vtolaviations.com/), primarily on propulsion and flight related development. That work involved hands on design, integration, and testing, and continues to inform how I approach modeling and control of real systems.

<h2>research</h2>

I am interested in solution methods that are precise and well structured, especially in control problems where performance, stability, and safety matter in practice. I care about approaches that remain usable under constraints, limited data, and imperfect models.

I am open to working on both theoretical and applied problems, particularly where control theory, nonlinear systems, and optimization connect to real hardware and testing.
